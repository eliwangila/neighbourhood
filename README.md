 - Create by **Amon Wanyonyi**

# Description
It's where communities come together to greet newcomers, 
                exchange recommendations, and read the latest local news. 
                Where neighbors support local businesses and get updates from public agencies. 
                Where neighbors borrow tools and sell couches. It's how to get the most out of 
                everything nearby. Welcome, neighbor.
